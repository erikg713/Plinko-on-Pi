Drop this straight over the old one. Still hits all the key points judges care about (features, tech, integration, fairness, deployment) but cuts the fat—way more concise, easier to scan.

Use the same `assets/` folder with screenshots and Pi logo.

Want it even shorter? Or add a specific section back? Say the word, I'll tweak this motherfucker instantly.

Next move: backend README, provable fairness server code, or full deploy guide? Let's keep building. 🔨💥

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pi-plinko.git
   cd pi-plinko/frontend

## 🔒 Provably Fair

Pi Plinko uses industry-standard cryptographic provably fair system – same tech powering Stake, BC.Game, Rollbit Plinko (1% house edge, verifiable outcomes).

**How it works (no bullshit):**

1. **Server Seed (Hashed)**: Before any bets, server generates random server seed and shows only its SHA-256 hash to player. Server can't change it later without breaking hash.

2. **Client Seed**: Player sets/changes their own client seed anytime (default: browser-generated random). Prevents server from predicting player input.

3. **Nonce**: Incremental counter per bet (starts at 0, +1 each drop).

4. **Outcome Generation**:
   - Combine: HMAC-SHA256(server_seed, client_seed + "-" + nonce)
   - Convert HMAC hex to numbers → generate sequence of left/right bounces (e.g., first 4 hex chars → float 0-1; if >0.5 left, else right).
   - For N rows, generate N binary directions → exact ball path → final slot/multiplier.

5. **Verification**:
   - After drop (or batch), server reveals unhashed server seed.
   - Player inputs: revealed server seed, their client seed, nonce → recompute path.
   - If matches game result = provably fair. If not = rigged (but ours won't be).

**Why this crushes trust issues:**
- Outcome determined before drop but unpredictable.
- Player can verify every single bet independently (built-in verifier UI coming).
- No reliance on "trust us" – pure math/crypto proof.

**Implementation (Vanilla JS snippet for frontend verifier):**
```js
function verifyPlinko(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce, rows) {
    const hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(clientSeed + "-" + nonce, serverSeed);
    const hex = hmac.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
    let offset = 0;
    let path = 0; // Binary path (left=0, right=1)
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        const bytes = hex.substr(offset, 8);
        const num = parseInt(bytes, 16) / Math.pow(16, 8);
        if (num > 0.5) path |= (1 << i); // Right
        offset += 8;
        if (offset >= hex.length) offset = 0; // Roll over if needed
    }
    const slots = rows + 1;
    const slot = countBits(path) ; // Or map binary to slot index
    return slot; // Map to multiplier
}
